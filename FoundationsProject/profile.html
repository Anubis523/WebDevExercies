        <p> Hi my name is Kevin Steele. As of May 2018 I'll have earned a BFA in Computer Animation and Interactive Design. I'm not from New York though, originally I'm from the modest city of Charlotte, NC where many of my relatives have remained. My mother
            took me and my brother to NYC in 2000 to be nearer to her aging parents.There was some culture shock at first, everyone was in a hurry, spoke fast, and seemed to be fairly nonplussed by what to me seemed strange or even a little dangerous.
            It took some to adjust, but I soon became a New Yorker in my own right. I also fell in love with the various museums and art galleries open to visitors in NYC. My favorites I frequent the most are the Midtown Manhattan Library, the MOMA and
            Museum of Natural History. <br> <br> In my teens and early 20's I spent a lot of time drawing, skateboarding and attending school. But school didn't work out the first time around, I ran into some financial troubles. It took some time to clear
            up and I'm now about to graduate with a BFA. But skateboarding was one of my most favorite activities before I got a knee injury that makes skating no longer possible. I don't regret picking up the hobby because I've made lifelong friends
            and met terribly interesting people just by riding on what ostensibly is a 2x4 with skate trucks attached to big polyurethane wheels. I feel similarly about drawing, I don't want to do it for a living anymore but I just can't stop myself sometimes
            from wanting to explore a page. I suppose by this point you should know at least a little about me and I hope you found this fun and informative. Have a great day!!
